#Presentations

## November 13, 2014 @ Lisa Seattle

See [presentation page on Lisa website](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa14/conference-program/presentation/brandt) for slides, video and audio.  
This was the first presentation on Bosun, right after release.  Serves as a great introduction to the underlying thoughs on problems with alerting and how Bosun solves them.  Still highly relevant, although since then Bosun has gained a few new features, most notably support for graphite and logstash/elasticsearch.
